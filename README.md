# About me
Writer, musician, cyclist and developer. I'm Chilean, born in Concepción, but living in Santiago since I can remember. Even though I studied Hispanic Linguistics and Literature, minored in Music History, and have a Master’s Degree in Publishing, I've spent most of my professional life dedicated to the repair and assessment of computer-related equipment. I've been a huge fan of computers since I was five. I’m very passionate about everything that involves Game Development and Home Automation. I am always in the lookout for new knowledge.
